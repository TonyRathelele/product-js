Great choice! Agriculture is a powerful sector for AI, especially for solving problems related to food production, sustainability, and resource efficiency. Let‚Äôs walk through what you need to do next with **Agriculture** as your selected sector:

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Plan for Your Agriculture AI Project

---

### **1. Form a Team of 3-5 Members**

* Ensure team members have different strengths: one in tech, one in research, one in design, etc.

---

### **2. Research 3 Existing AI Applications in Agriculture**

You need to include these in your documentation. Examples:

| Application               | Description                                                                                       | AI Type                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Plantix**               | Mobile app that uses image recognition to identify plant diseases and give treatment suggestions. | Image recognition          |
| **Blue River Technology** | Smart sprayers that detect and target weeds to reduce pesticide use.                              | Computer vision & robotics |
| **Prospera**              | Analyzes real-time crop data (from cameras/sensors) to improve yield.                             | Predictive analytics       |

‚úÖ **Action**: Document:

* Name
* What it does
* What kind of AI it uses
* Its impact (e.g., % of yield improvement, cost saved)

---

### **3. Identify a Specific Problem to Solve**

Your goal is to find a **real, impactful problem in Agriculture** that AI can help solve. It must be:

* **Specific** (not generic like "help farmers")
* **Measurable** (with potential impact metrics)

#### Example Problems:

* Detecting early-stage crop diseases via photos (image classification)
* Predicting ideal harvest time using weather + soil data (predictive analytics)
* Recommending fertilizer amounts based on crop and soil condition (text or regression model)
* Analyzing text-based farmer questions in multiple languages and giving advice (text generation/analysis)

‚úÖ **Action**: Choose one problem and define:

* Who is affected
* What the pain point is
* How AI will solve it
* How success will be measured (e.g., 30% disease detection improvement)

---

### **4. Create Your Functional No-Code AI Prototype**

Pick a tool depending on your chosen problem:

| AI Task                 | Tools You Can Use                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Classification          | [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), [Lobe.ai](https://www.lobe.ai/) |
| Text generation or Q\&A | [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)                                           |
| Predictive analytics    | [Obviously AI](https://www.obviously.ai/)                                                      |
| Image recognition       | [Lobe.ai](https://www.lobe.ai/)                                                                |

#### Your prototype must include:

* ‚úÖ Data Input (e.g., upload image, type question)
* ‚úÖ AI Processing (e.g., classifies disease, gives answer)
* ‚úÖ Output (easy to read result or suggestion)
* ‚úÖ Error handling (e.g., if no match found, show message)

---

### **5. Build a Data Flow Diagram**

Use Figma, Miro, or Lucidchart.

Sample flow:

```
[Farmer uploads leaf photo] ‚Üí [AI model classifies disease] ‚Üí [Output screen shows disease + treatment] ‚Üí [Option to upload another]
```

---

### **6. Add 2 User Interaction Points**

Example:

1. Upload a photo or type a question.
2. Click to view results or ask follow-up.

---

### **7. Document APIs or Tools Used**

Make a table like this:

| Tool/API | Function                                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Lobe.ai  | Used for image classification of crop disease |
| Zapier   | Connects front end to backend                 |
| Figma    | UI prototyping                                |

---

### **8. Create an Interactive Figma or Miro Prototype**

* Simulate user input screen, AI processing, and result screen.
* Include buttons and flows, not just static mockups.

---

### **9. Create a 2-Minute Demo Video**

* Show how your no-code prototype works.
* Narrate each step:

  * What user does
  * What AI does
  * What result looks like

---

### **10. Create a Slide Deck (10-12 Slides)**

Suggested Outline:

1. Title slide
2. Team members
3. Sector: Agriculture
4. Problem statement
5. Research on 3 AI applications
6. Your proposed solution
7. How your prototype works
8. Data flow diagram
9. Impact metrics
10. Ethical analysis summary
11. Future improvements
12. Q\&A

---

### **11. Write a 2-Page Ethical Analysis**

Include:

* üîç **Bias sources** (e.g., photos from only one region or crop type)
* üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy concerns** (e.g., user location data)
* ‚ôø **Accessibility** (language, literacy level)
* üåç **Environmental impact** (cloud AI energy usage)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unintended consequences** (overdependence on AI advice)

---
